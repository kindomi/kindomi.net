## Special Notice to California Residents (CCPA)
This section describes how we collect, use, disclose, and/or "sell" (as defined under California law) personal information of California consumers, and the rights you may have under California law. These disclosures are intended to supplement this policy with information required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We note that the definition of "personal information" in California is expanded to include information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a particular person or household.

To understand what personal information we may have collected about you in the past 12 months and from where we collected it, please see other information disclosures in this policy about what personal information we may collect, store, and share about you and with third parties to operate, manage, and maintain our business, to provide our products and services, and to accomplish our business purposes and objectives.

We may share such personal information with the types of third parties listed herein. California law requires that we provide you with additional information about certain disclosures to such third parties within the past 12 months, particularly, where the disclosure involves monetary or other considerations. California treats these disclosures as sales of information, even where no money is exchanged. We do not sell data.

We may, however, have disclosed, in the past 12 months, the following categories of personal information to the following third parties for our operational "business purposes" as defined by California law:

| Categories of Personal Information | Categories of Third Parties |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|

| Internet or other electronic network activity information | service providers |
| Geolocation data | service providers, business partners |
| Sensitive personal information | service providers |
| Audio, electronic, or visual information | service providers, business partners |

We do not sell, or have actual knowledge of any sale of, the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

### Your Rights
You have a right to notice, upon collection, of the categories of personal information collected and for which purposes the data will be used. You have the right to access a copy of the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we collect, use, disclose, and/or sell about you, and the right to ask us to delete/anonymize your personal information, with limited exceptions. You also have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. Finally, you have the right to be free from discrimination for exercising your rights. As noted above, we do not sell your information.

If you would like to submit a consumer request, you can contact us at support@kindomi.net. If you choose to submit a consumer request, you must provide us with enough information to identify you and enough specificity on the requested data. We will only use the information it receives to respond to your request. We will not be able to disclose information if it cannot verify that the person making the consumer request is the person about whom we collected information, or someone authorized to act on such person's behalf.

For the purposes of this section, "personal information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. "Personal information" does not include publicly available information.

### Request Types
1. **Request to Correct**: You may correct or update your personal information at any time by logging into your account or by contacting us.

Please note that the categories of personal information, sources, and disclosure will not exceed what is contained in this policy. Additionally, we are not required to retain any information about you if it is only used for a one-time transaction and would not be maintained in the ordinary course of business. We are also not required to re-identify personal information if it is not stored in that manner already, nor is it required to provide the personal information to you more than twice in a twelve-month period.

### Request to Delete
You may request that we delete personal information we have collected from you. Subject to certain exceptions set out below we will, on receipt of a verifiable consumer request, delete your personal information from our records, direct any service providers to do the same, and notify all third parties to whom we have shared your personal information to delete it unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

Please note that we may not delete your personal information if it is necessary to:

1. Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated by the consumer within the context of a business' ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.
2. Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of the consumer's personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.
3. Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
4. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer's right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.
5. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
6. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research that conforms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if the consumer has provided informed consent.
7. To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer's relationship with the business, and compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.
8. Comply with a legal obligation.

To use an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you will need to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, provide the company with signed permission for the authorized agent to act on your behalf, and you will need to verify your identity directly with the company.

We may not, and will not, treat you differently because of your consumer request activity. As a result of your consumer request activity, we may not and will not deny goods or services to you; charge different rates for goods or services; provide a different level of quality of goods or services; or suggest any of the preceding will occur. However, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. Furthermore, we can and may charge you a different rate, or provide a different level of quality, if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your personal information.

We do not sell the personal information of consumers under the age of 16 if we have actual knowledge of the individual's age. We do not sell personal information as the term is traditionally understood, versus the definition under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For example, we do not exchange, for money, personal information to data brokers or third parties for their marketing purposes independent of us.

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)
We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under the age of 13 and seek compliance with the Children's Online Privacy & Protection Act (COPPA). In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under 13, please contact us at support@kindomi.net. Children should request permission from their parent or guardian prior to sending personal information online. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal data to us. If we become aware or suspect a minor under the age of 13 has become a registered user, we reserve the right to suspend and/or delete the account and past event system data at our sole discretion, with or without notice. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their minor children's Internet usage and to help enforce our policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data, please contact us at support@kindomi.net and we will use reasonable efforts to assist in the deletion of the child's personal information. For children ages 13-16, and/or those aged 13-16 who reside in California, you may not be able to become a registered user. In certain cases, upon our sole discretion, on a case by case basis, we may permit a minor aged 13-16 to become a registered user if we obtain a parent or guardian consent form.

## Applicable Law
This policy is governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of this policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts within California. If any provision of this policy is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this policy, which shall remain in full force and effect.
