# **What’s Keeping Us Awake at Night**

**Aging is inevitable.** As we grow older, we face challenges that our parents are likely to encounter ahead of us—mental health struggles and navigating life in an ever-changing world that often prioritizes the young.

In a world driven by capitalism, our **Room for Error** is shrinking, both financially and mentally. This pressure limits our ability to explore our true potential and achieve self-actualization. Not everyone has the resources or opportunities to pursue a path that allows them to live to their fullest.

While we may have managed to build our lives, what about the next generation?  
- Are we confident that our children will find their own unique way?  
- When we reach the limits of our ability to support them, can we trust society to step in?

# **Our Mission**

We envision a future inspired by the values of Enlightenment and Renaissance—where individual value is deeply honored, human connection is treasured, and optimism fuels progress.

Our mission is to "**use technology to empower people to collaborate better**". Our motto is "**innovations to build connections that last**": fostering relationships that endure across generations, cultivating growth, and creating opportunities for individuals to realize their full potential.

However, this vision is only meaningful if it is both sustainable and actionable. Real impact comes from solving challenges that are viable in a business context—creating solutions that last and deliver true value to humanity.
